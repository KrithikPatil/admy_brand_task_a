# AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used
- Primary tools: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Grok, VS Code Copilot Chat
- Key use cases: Rapid prototyping of dashboard components, chart integration, UI/UX enhancements, troubleshooting errors, and generating documentation.

## Sample Prompts
1. "Create a responsive React dashboard component with advanced charting and export features."
2. "Add a draggable legend to radar and radial charts for interactive filtering."
3. "Implement fade-in animations for dashboard charts using framer-motion."
4. "Fix the error in my radial bar chart: <path> attribute d: Expected number, ..."

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated:** Approximately 70% of the codebase was generated or scaffolded using AI tools. This includes the initial setup of the Next.js project, creation of reusable UI components (cards, buttons), chart integration with Recharts, and implementation of features like export/print, fade-in animations, and interactive legends. AI also assisted in debugging errors and suggesting best practices for responsive design and accessibility.
- **Manual coding:** About 30% of the work involved manual coding, such as customizing chart logic, refining UI details, integrating user-uploaded data, and resolving edge cases not covered by AI suggestions. Manual edits were also made to ensure visual consistency, optimize performance, and adapt the dashboard to specific business requirements.
- **Customization:** AI-generated code was frequently adapted to match the project's branding, data structure, and user experience goals. This included modifying color schemes, adjusting chart dimensions, and enhancing interactivity. The final product reflects a blend of AI-driven scaffolding and manual refinement, resulting in a modern, user-friendly analytics dashboard tailored for ADmyBRAND Insights.
